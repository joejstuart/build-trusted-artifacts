# Trusted artifacts

A trusted artifact a way to pass files between two Tekton Tasks without those
files being clandestinely modified. This is done by tracking the digest of
archived files.
A Tekton Task creating a trusted artifact for later use needs to add a result
named "ARTIFACTS" and step, for example:

```yaml
spec:
  results:
    - name: ARTIFACTS
      type: array
      description: Produced trusted artifact
  steps:
    - name: create-trusted-artifact
      image: (image built from this repository)
      args:
        - create
        - <name1>=<directory1/file1>
        - <name2>=<directory2/file2>
```

Example:
```yaml
spec:
  results:
    - name: ARTIFACTS
      type: array
      description: Produced trusted artifact
  steps:
    - name: git-clone
    - name: create-trusted-artifact
      image: (image built from this repository)
      args:
        - create
        - source=${workspaces.source.path}
```

For name of an artifact, it is convinient to use the TaskRun name:
`$(context.taskRun.name)`, especially if the task produces a single artifact.

More than one trusted artifact can be created from that single step by appending
to the `args` list.

The `create` operation (as used above), will generate a result named
`ARTIFACTS`, an array containing an entry for each of the artifacts created in
specified order. The value of the result entry is used to restore the artifact
with the `use` operation. For example, by adding a step:

```yaml
spec:
  steps:
    - name: use-trusted-artifact
      image: (image built from this repository)
      args:
        - use
        - <result entry1>=<destination1>
        - <result entry2>=<destination2>
```

Since the resulting entry cannot be, in vast majority of cases, predetermined,
referencing the result from the step performing the `create` operation is most
common way of using the `use` operation.

Example:
```yaml
- name: use-trusted-artifact
    image: (image built from this repository)
    args:
        - use
        - $(tasks.clone.results.ARTIFACTS[0])=$(workspaces.source.path)/src
```

In that example the first entry of the resulting `ARTIFACTS` array of the `clone`
task is restored to the `source` workspace to the subdirectory `src`.

# Running the demo

First make sure that the access information to a image repository is already
present in the `$HOME/.docker/config.json` file. That is `docker login` was used
to populate it. Set the environment variable `REPOSITORY` to the image
repository used, e.g.:

```shell
export REPOSITORY=quay.io/username
```

The `hack/demo.sh` will push to `$REPOSITORY/build-trusted-artifacts` and
`$REPOSITORY/golden`.

The demo script patches the `git-clone` and `buildah` Task definitions form
https://github.com/redhat-appstudio/build-definitions/ and expects that
repository to be cloned in `../build-definitions` directory.

With that setup, the `hack/demo.sh`, will spin up a kind cluster, setup
PersistantVolume and PersistantVolumenClaim backed by the `storage` local
directory; install Tekton Pipelines and run a Pipeline with `git-clone` and
`buildah-tasks`.

Have a look in the `hack/kustomization.yaml` to see how the Tasks ware modified
so that they use trusted artifacts.

### Running from a container
```bash
podman build . -t quay.io/my-org/build-trusted-artifacts
podman run -v ~/.docker/config.json:/home/notroot/.docker/config.json:ro -it quay.io/my-org/build-trusted-artifacts create-oci --store quay.io/my-org/trusted-artifacts bundles=/tmp
```
